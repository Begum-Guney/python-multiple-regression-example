# Multiple Linear Regression: Weather Data Example

This project demonstrates a multiple linear regression model using Python, `statsmodels`, and `seaborn`.

While the dataset includes real weather observations, the main goal is not to build a highly accurate temperature prediction model — but rather to explore how these Python libraries can be used to generate interpretable regression outputs and visualizations.
